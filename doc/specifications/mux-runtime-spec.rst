ComputeMux Runtime Specification
================================

   This is version 0.81.0 of the specification.

ComputeMux is Codeplay’s proprietary API for executing compute workloads across
heterogeneous devices. ComputeMux is an extremely lightweight,
bare-to-the-metal abstraction on modern hardware, and is used to power a suite
of open source standards. ComputeMux consists of a :doc:`Runtime Specification
</specifications/mux-runtime-spec>` and :doc:`Compiler Specification
</specifications/mux-compiler-spec>`. This document refers to the Runtime
component.

Throughout this specification, ComputeMux has been shortened to Mux for brevity,
but for the avoidance of all doubt, "Mux" refers to "ComputeMux".

Glossary
--------

The key statements **must**, **must not**, **shall**, **shall not**,
**should**, **should not**, **may**, in this document are to be
interpreted as described in `IETF RFC
2119 <http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt>`__.

-  **must** or **shall** - means that the definition is an absolute
   requirement of the specification.
-  **must not** or **shall not** - means that the definition is an
   absolute prohibition of the specification.
-  **should** - means that the definition is highly likely to occur, but
   there are extraneous circumstances that could result in it not
   occurring.
-  **should not** - means that the definition is highly likely to not
   occur, but there are extraneous circumstances that could result in it
   occurring.
-  **may** - means that an item is optional.

Introduction
------------

This document describes the Mux API, how it is used, and requirements to
follow on its usage.

Allocators
----------

All host-side allocations performed by Mux **should** use the user
provided allocators. A valid exception could be to implement Mux on top
of another framework, e.g., LLVM, which does not support user provided
allocators.

Many Mux API functions take a ``mux_allocator_info_t`` object which
specifies the allocator to use for their related object creation,
destruction, and operation of the object:

.. code:: c

   typedef struct mux_allocator_info_s mux_allocator_info_t;

Where ``mux_allocator_info_s`` is defined to be:

.. code:: c

   struct mux_allocator_info_s {
     void* (*alloc)(void* user_data, size_t size, size_t alignment);
     void (*free)(void* user_data, void* pointer);
     void* user_data;
   };

-  ``alloc`` - allocate aligned memory.
-  ``free`` - free previously allocated memory.
-  ``user_data`` - user data passed to each call of ``alloc`` and
   ``free``.

.. rubric:: Valid Usage

-  ``alloc`` **must not** be NULL, otherwise ``mux_allocator_info_s`` is
   invalid.
-  ``free`` **must not** be NULL, otherwise ``mux_allocator_info_s`` is
   invalid.
-  ``user_data`` **may** be NULL.
-  Calls to ``alloc()`` **should** return a valid pointer address, the
   address of which **must** be sized to the ``size`` argument and
   **must** be aligned to the ``alignment`` argument.
-  Calls to ``free()`` **must** succeed for any ``pointer`` argument
   that was previously returned from ``alloc()``.
-  Calls to ``alloc()`` and ``free()`` **must** be callable from
   concurrent threads of execution. Mux device’s are not required to
   lock calls to these callbacks.

Functions with a ``mux_allocator_info_t`` parameter check that the
``alloc`` and ``free`` fields are not ``NULL`` but they do not perform
exhaustive testing, e.g., it is not tested if the argument to a
``muxDestroy...`` function matches the ``mux_allocator_info_t`` argument
passed to the matching ``muxCreate...`` function.

Callbacks
---------

Mux supports a callback message reporting mechanism which allows
implementations to inform the user of detailed information relating to
their use of the API. This mechanism is optional. There are two entry
points which these callbacks **may** be supplied to,
`muxCreateFinalizer <#muxcreatefinalizer>`__ and
`muxCreateCommandBuffer <#muxcreatecommandbuffer>`__, both take a
``mux_callback_info_t`` which is defined as.

.. code:: c

   typedef struct mux_callback_info_s* mux_callback_info_t;

Where ``mux_callback_info_s`` is defined to be:

.. code:: c

   struct mux_callback_info_s {
     void (*callback)(
         void* user_data,
         const char* message,
         const void* data,
         size_t data_size);
     void *user_data;
   };

-  ``callback`` - callback to provide detailed information about an
   error or to provide optimization hints to the user.

   -  ``user_data`` - Pointer to the user data provided by the user.
   -  ``message`` - String containing a message from the implementation
      to the user.
   -  ``data`` - An implementation defined binary data blob containing
      additional data, **may** be null.
   -  ``data_size`` - The size in bytes of the data blob, **must** be
      ``0`` if ``data`` is NULL.

-  ``user_data`` - User data provided by the user.

.. rubric:: Valid Usage

-  ``callback`` **must not** be NULL, otherwise ``mux_callback_info_s``
   is invalid.
-  ``user_data`` **may** be NULL.

Devices
-------

Mux is designed to support multiple devices. Each device conforms to the
same API, but is allowed to expose differing capabilities. For example,
device A could support images, whereas device B might not.

There are multiple possible types of device which are distinguished by
the ``mux_device_type_e`` enumeration.

.. code:: c

   enum mux_device_type_e {
     mux_device_type_cpu = (0x1 << 0),
     mux_device_type_gpu_integrated = (0x1 << 1),
     mux_device_type_gpu_discrete = (0x1 << 2),
     mux_device_type_gpu_virtual = (0x1 << 3),
     mux_device_type_accelerator = (0x1 << 4),
     mux_device_type_custom = (0x1 << 5),
     mux_device_type_compiler = (0x1 << 6),
     mux_device_type_all = 0xFFFFFFFF
   };

-  ``mux_device_type_cpu`` - device is a CPU.
-  ``mux_device_type_gpu_integrated`` - device is an integrated GPU.
-  ``mux_device_type_gpu_discrete`` - device is a discrete GPU.
-  ``mux_device_type_gpu_virtual`` - device is a virtualized GPU.
-  ``mux_device_type_accelerator`` - device is an accelerator chip.
-  ``mux_device_type_custom`` - device is a mysterious custom type.
-  ``mux_device_type_compiler`` - device is a compiler, used for offline
   and cross compilation.
-  ``mux_device_type_all`` - bit-mask to match all device types.

An instance of ``mux_device_info_t`` contains the information about a
device’s capabilities and related metadata, and ``mux_device_t`` stores
an initialized device’s state. A device for which ``mux_device_info_t``
**may** not be initializable, for example if it’s not physically present
in the system, but it can still be useful as a target for compilation.

.. rubric:: Valid Usage

-  ``allocation_capabilities`` **must** have at least one of
   ``mux_allocation_capabilities_coherent_host`` or
   ``mux_allocation_capabilities_alloc_device`` bits set.
-  ``allocation_size`` **must** be greater than ``0`` if ``memory_size``
   is greater than ``0``.
-  ``allocation_size`` **must** be less than or equal to ``memory_size``
-  ``compute_units`` **must** be greater than ``0``.
-  If the ``mux_source_capabilities_builtin_kernel`` bit of
   ``source_capabilities`` is set, then ``builtin_kernel_declarations``
   **must** point to a null-terminated C string of semicolon-separated
   built-in kernel *declarations*.
-  Built-in kernel *declarations* **must** conform to the `built-in
   kernel declaration syntax <#built-in-kernel-declaration-syntax>`__,
   defined below.

Built-In Kernel Declaration Syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Built-in kernel *declarations* **must** be of the form
``kernel_name(parameters)``. The declarations conform to the OpenCL 1.2
kernel declaration syntax with the following exceptions:

1. The leading ``__kernel`` keyword **must not** be used
2. The return type (``void``) **must** be omitted
3. Pointer parameters using ``[]`` notation **must not** be used
4. Struct parameters and pointer-to-struct parameters **must not** be
   used
5. Type and variable attributes (e.g., ``__attribute__*``) **must not**
   be used
6. All whitespace **must** only be `` `` characters; other whitespace
   characters (``\t``, ``\n``, etc.) **must not** be used
7. The built-in kernel name including a trailing NUL character must not
   exceed ``CL_NAME_VERSION_KHR`` (64 characters).

Also note that two OpenCL limitations are present for built-in kernel
parameter:

1. OpenCL kernels do not support pointer-to-pointer parameters
2. The OpenCL API ignores ``const`` and ``volatile`` qualifiers on value
   parameters. These **may** or **may not** be reported. (The OpenCL C
   compiler will not ignore the qualifiers.)

This is an example of a valid list of built-in kernel declarations:

.. code:: c

   mux_device_info_s_ptr->builtin_kernel_declarations =
     "kernel1(global const int* in, global int* out);"
     "kernel2(read_only image3d_t in, read_write image2d_t out, float val);"
     "kernel3(local const float* restrict in, __global volatile float* out)";
   };

muxGetDeviceInfos
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``muxGetDeviceInfos()`` calls into Mux to enumerate device for which
information is registered with Mux.

.. code:: c

   mux_result_t muxGetDeviceInfos(
       uint32_t device_types,
       uint64_t device_infos_length,
       mux_device_info_t *out_device_infos,
       uint64_t *out_device_infos_length);

-  ``device_types`` - a bitfield of ``mux_device_type_e`` specifying the
   types of devices to retrieve the device information from,
   ``mux_device_type_all`` can be used to specify all devices.
-  ``device_infos_length`` - the length of ``out_device_infos``.
-  ``out_device_infos`` - an array of Mux devices information.
-  ``out_device_infos_length`` - the total number of devices for which
   information was recorded in ``out_device_infos``.

``muxGetDeviceInfos()`` can be called in two configurations.

.. code:: c

   uint64_t device_infos_length = 0;
   mux_result_t error =
       muxGetDeviceInfos(mux_device_type_all, 0, NULL, &device_infos_length);

This first configuration sets ``device_infos_length`` to 0,
``out_device_infos`` to NULL, and passes a valid pointer for
``out_device_infos_length`` - on success ``out_device_infos_length``
will contain the total number of devices for which information is
recorded in Mux.

.. code:: c

   mux_device_info_t *device_infos =
       malloc(sizeof(mux_device_info_t) * device_infos_length);
   error = muxGetDeviceInfos(mux_device_type_all, device_infos_length,
                              device_infos, 0);

This second configuration sets ``device_infos_length`` to a non-zero
number, ``out_device_infos`` to a non-NULL pointer, and passes NULL for
``out_device_infos_length`` - on success ``out_device_infos`` will
contain ``device_infos_length`` number of valid Mux device information
entries to use.

The returned ``mux_device_info_t``\ s have static lifetimes, and **must
not** require any destruction logic.

.. rubric:: Return Codes

-  If ``device_types`` is 0, ``mux_error_invalid_value`` **must**
   be returned.
-  If ``device_infos_length`` is 0 and ``out_device_infos`` is not NULL,
   ``mux_error_invalid_value`` **must** be returned.
-  If ``device_infos_length`` is not 0 and ``out_device_infos`` is NULL,
   ``mux_error_null_out_parameter`` **must** be returned.
-  Otherwise ``mux_success`` **should** be returned.

If an error code other than ``mux_success`` is returned, all
``out_device_infos`` **must not** be used.

.. rubric:: Valid Usage

-  Calls to ``muxGetDeviceInfos()`` **shall** be considered thread-safe.

muxGetDeviceInfos_t hook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Related to ``muxGetDeviceInfos`` is the device information hook, which
**must** be implemented by each of the target implementations in order
to support enumerating devices owned by that implementation. A function
signature for a target ``target`` would look as follows:

.. code:: c

   mux_result_t targetGetDeviceInfos(
       uint32_t device_types,
       uint64_t device_infos_length,
       mux_device_info_t* out_device_infos,
       uint64_t* out_device_infos_length);

The arguments have a very similar meaning as the ones of
``muxGetDeviceInfos``, with the difference that it only needs to handle
its own device list, it doesn’t know about other devices registered in
the system. The hook should support being called with a null
``out_device_infos`` argument to get the number of devices it wants to
register. It should also support being called with
``device_infos_length`` set to that number to populate the
``out_device_infos`` array.

muxCreateDevices
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: c

   struct mux_device_s {
     mux_id_t id;
     mux_device_info_t info;
   };

``muxCreateDevices()`` calls into Mux to create and initialize the list
of devices registered with Mux.

.. code:: c

   mux_result_t muxCreateDevices(
       uint64_t devices_length,
       mux_device_info_t *device_infos,
       mux_allocator_info_t allocator_info,
       mux_device_t *out_devices);

-  ``devices_length`` - the total number of devices to initialize, the
   length of the ``device_infos`` and ``out_devices`` arrays.
-  ``device_infos`` - array of device information determining which
   devices to create, the entries **must** have come from a
   ``muxGetDeviceInfos()`` call.
-  ``allocator_info`` - the user provided allocator **should** be used
   for host memory allocations as described in the
   `Allocators <#allocators>`_ section.
-  ``out_devices`` - the newly created devices.

Example usage:

.. code:: c

   uint64_t chosen_devices_count = ...;
   mux_device_info_t *chosen_device_infos = ...;
   mux_allocator_info_t allocator = ...;
   mux_device_t *devices = NULL;
   error = muxCreateDevices(chosen_devices_count, chosen_device_infos,
                             allocator, devices);

.. rubric:: Return Codes

-  If ``devices_length`` is greater than 0 and ``device_infos`` is NULL,
   ``mux_error_invalid_value`` **must** be returned.
-  If ``devices_length`` is greater than 0 and ``out_devices`` is NULL,
   ``mux_error_null_out_parameter`` **must** be returned.
-  If at least one of the ``device_infos`` represents a device that is
   not available for initialization (e.g. if it’s only a target for
   cross-compilation), ``mux_error_feature_unsupported`` **must** be
   returned.
-  If ``allocator_info`` function pointer fields are ``NULL``,
   ``mux_error_null_allocator_callback`` **must** be returned.
-  If ``out_devices`` is ``NULL``, then ``mux_error_null_out_parameter``
   **must** be returned.
-  Otherwise ``mux_success`` **should** be returned.

If an error code other than ``mux_success`` is returned, all of
the ``out_devices`` **must not** be used.

.. rubric:: Valid Usage

-  Calls to ``muxGetDeviceInfos()`` **shall not** be considered
   thread-safe.
-  If any of the ``device_infos`` did not originate from a call to
   ``muxGetDeviceInfos()``, the behavior is undefined.
-  The ``device_infos`` array can contain less elements than the one
   provided by ``muxGetDeviceInfos()``, but their order **must** be
   maintained. Otherwise the behavior is undefined.

muxCreateDevices_t hook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Related to ``muxCreateDevices`` is the device creation hook, which
**must** be implemented by each of the target implementations in order
to support creating devices owned by that implementation. A function
signature for a target ``target`` would look as follows:

.. code:: c

   mux_result_t targetCreateDevices(
       uint64_t devices_length,
       mux_device_info_t* device_infos,
       mux_allocator_info_t allocator,
       mux_device_t* out_devices);

The arguments have the same meaning as the ones of ``muxCreateDevices``.
The hook should iterate over the ``device_infos`` array, and create its
own device objects at the indices corresponding to info object entries
managed by that target. The hook can also return an error code to
signify failure.

The arguments have a very similar meaning as the ones of
``muxCreateDevices``, with the difference that a hook only needs to
handle its own device list, it doesn’t know about other devices
registered in the system.

A device creation hook **must** not check for the errors described by
the ``muxCreateDevices`` return code section as these are detected and
handled before the hook is called.

muxDestroyDevice
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``muxDestroyDevice()`` destroys a previously created ``mux_device_t``.
Note that ``muxDestroyDevice()`` destroys a single device only - If
``muxCreateDevices()`` returned multiple devices, each has to be
destroyed individually.

.. code:: c

   void muxDestroyDevice(
       mux_device_t device,
       mux_allocator_info_t allocator_info);

-  ``device`` - a device previously created by a call to
   ``muxCreateDevices()``.
-  ``allocator_info`` - the user provided allocator ``device`` was
   created with.

.. rubric:: Valid Usage

-  The ``allocator_info`` passed to ``muxDestroyDevice()`` **must** be
   the same ``mux_allocator_info_t`` as was used in the call to
   ``muxCreateDevices()`` that created ``device``.
-  Calls to ``muxDestroyDevice()`` with a given ``device`` **shall** be

Executables
-----------

Executables in Mux are created from a binary representation compatible with the
current device. Executables **may** contain multiple entry points.

A Mux executable will have one or more named kernels.

muxCreateExecutable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``muxCreateExecutable()`` creates an executable from a given binary.

.. code:: c

   mux_result_t muxCreateExecutable(
       mux_device_t device,
       const void* binary,
       uint64_t binary_length,
       mux_allocator_info_t allocator_info,
       mux_executable_t* out_executable);

-  ``device`` - the device to create the executable with.
-  ``binary`` - an array containing the binary to load.
-  ``binary_length`` - the length, in bytes, of ``binary``.
-  ``allocator_info`` - the user provided allocator **should** be used
   for host memory allocations as described in the
   `Allocators <#allocators>`__ section.
-  ``out_executable`` - the newly created executable.

.. rubric:: Return Codes

-  If ``binary`` is NULL, ``mux_error_invalid_value`` **must** be
   returned.
-  If ``binary_length`` is 0, ``mux_error_invalid_value`` **must**
   be returned.
-  If ``allocator_info`` function pointer fields are ``NULL``,
   ``mux_error_null_allocator_callback`` **must** be returned.
-  If ``out_executable`` is NULL, ``mux_error_null_out_parameter``
   **must** be returned.
-  Otherwise ``mux_success`` **should** be returned.

If an error code other than ``mux_success`` is returned,
``out_executable`` **must not** be used.

.. rubric:: Valid Usage

-  Calls to ``muxCreateExecutable()`` **shall** be considered thread-safe.

muxDestroyExecutable
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``muxDestroyExecutable()`` destroys a previously created
``mux_executable_t``.

.. code:: c

   void muxDestroyExecutable(
       mux_device_t device,
       mux_executable_t executable,
       mux_allocator_t allocator_info);

-  ``device`` - the device the executable was created with.
-  ``executable`` - an executable previously created by a call to
   ``muxCreateExecutable()``.
-  ``allocator_info`` - the user provided allocator ``executable`` was
   created with.

.. rubric:: Valid Usage

-  Calls to ``muxDestroyExecutable()`` with a given ``executable``
   **shall** be considered thread-safe.

   has been destroyed.
-  If the ``binary`` that was used in the creation of a ``mux_executable_t`` was
   returned by ``compiler::Kernel::createSpecializedKernel``, the
   ``compiler::Kernel`` object **must not** be destroyed before the executable
   has been destroyed.

Descriptors
-----------

Executables that run on a Mux device are passed data from the host via
``mux_descriptor_info_t``\ ’s. As the name suggests, descriptors specify
what the data for a given parameter is. When descriptors are passed to a
Mux device a copy is made of the data contained within, once the entry
point consuming the descriptors completes the storage can be reused or
freed.

.. code:: c

   struct mux_descriptor_info_s {
     uint32_t type;
     union {
       struct mux_descriptor_info_buffer_s buffer_descriptor;

Kernels
-------

Kernels in Mux are created from a ``mux_executable_t``. Kernels
represent a single, named, entry point into an executable. Kernels
contain fields called ``preferred_local_size_x``,
``preferred_local_size_y``, and ``preferred_local_size_z`` which can be
used by the implementation to signal preferred defaults for when a kernel is
compiled.

.. code:: c

   struct mux_kernel_s {

Memory
------

Memory in Mux represents physical memory allocations that are accessible
on a device.

.. code:: c

   struct mux_memory_s {
     uint64_t size;
     uint32_t properties;
     uint64_t handle;
   };

-  ``size`` - the size (in bytes) that this memory has allocated to it.
-  ``properties`` - the memory properties of the allocated device
   memory.
-  ``handle`` - a handle to the allocated memory. For memory objects
   with the ``mux_memory_property_host_visible`` property this **must**
   be a host accessible pointer.

muxAllocateMemory
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``muxAllocateMemory()`` allocates some physical device memory on the
given Mux device.

.. code:: c

   mux_result_t muxAllocateMemory(
       mux_device_t device,
       size_t size,
       uint32_t heap,
       uint32_t memory_properties,
       mux_allocation_type_e allocation_type,
       uint32_t alignment,
       mux_allocator_info_t allocator_info,
       mux_memory_t* out_memory);

-  ``device`` - the ``mux_device_t`` to allocate this memory for.
-  ``size`` - the size in bytes of memory to allocate.
-  ``heap`` - value of a single set bit in the
   ``mux_memory_requirements_s::supported_heaps`` bitfield of the buffer
   or image the device memory is being allocated for.
-  ``memory_properties`` - bitfield of memory properties this allocation
   should support:

   -  ``mux_memory_property_device_local`` - Memory is visible only on
      the device and can not be mapped. Must not be used in combination
      with ``mux_memory_property_host_visible``,
      ``mux_memory_property_host_coherent``, or
      ``mux_memory_property_host_cached``.
   -  ``mux_memory_property_host_visible`` - Memory is visible on host
      and device, can be mapped using ``muxMapMemory()``. Can be used
      with ``mux_memory_property_host_coherent`` or
      ``mux_memory_property_host_cached``.
   -  ``mux_memory_property_host_coherent`` - Memory caches are coherent
      between host and device. No explicit synchronization is required.
      Can be used with ``mux_memory_property_host_visible``, is mutually
      exclusive with ``mux_memory_property_host_cached``.
   -  ``mux_memory_property_host_cached`` - Memory caches are not
      coherent between host and device. Explicit synchronization is
      required, using ``muxMapMemory()`` and ``muxUnmapMemory()``,
      before updates are visible on host or device. Can be used with
      ``mux_memory_property_host_visible``, is mutually exclusive with
      ``mux_memory_property_host_coherent``.

-  ``allocation_type`` - the type of allocation.

   -  ``mux_allocation_type_alloc_host`` - Allocate pinned memory
      visible on both host and device. Used in combination with
      ``mux_memory_property_host_coherent`` or
      ``mux_memory_property_host_cached``.
   -  ``mux_allocation_type_alloc_device`` - Allocate device memory. Can
      be used with ``mux_memory_property_device_local`` or
      ``mux_memory_property_host_visible``.

-  ``alignment`` - minimum alignment in bytes to allocate to, may be
   ``0`` to indicate no alignment requirement.
-  ``allocator_info`` - the user provided allocator **should** be used
   for host memory allocations as described in the
   `Allocators <#allocators>`__ section.
-  ``out_memory`` - the created memory, or uninitialized if an error
   occurred.

..

   Note that ``allocator_info`` **must** be used for any allocations
   required for the host-side implementation of this API entry point.
   There is no requirement for it to be used for the allocation of
   physical device memory.

.. rubric:: Return Codes

-  If ``size`` is 0, ``mux_error_invalid_value`` **must** be
   returned.
-  If ``heap`` is 0 ``mux_error_invalid_value`` **must** be
   returned.
-  If ``memory_properties`` is 0, ``mux_error_invalid_value``
   **must** be returned.
-  If ``alignment`` is not ``0`` and not a power of two
   ``mux_error_invalid_value`` **must** be returned.
-  If ``allocator_info`` function pointer fields are ``NULL``,
   ``mux_error_null_allocator_callback`` **must** be returned.
-  If ``out_memory`` is NULL, ``mux_error_null_out_parameter`` **must**
   be returned.
-  Otherwise ``mux_success`` **should** be returned.

   ``mux_allocation_type_alloc_device``.

muxCreateMemoryFromHost
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``muxCreateMemoryFromHost()`` assigns Mux device visible memory from
pre-allocated host side memory. The device visible memory assigned is
cache coherent with the host allocation, therefore the ``properties``
member of the returned ``mux_memory_t`` object **must** be set to
``mux_memory_property_host_visible`` and
``mux_memory_property_host_coherent``.

``muxFreeMemory()`` should be used to release the created
``mux_memory_t`` object at the end of its lifetime, but will not
deallocate the underlying host memory.

Mapping the created ``mux_memory_t`` object with ``muxMapMemory()``
**must** return a pointer in ``out_data`` based on the ``host_pointer``
argument used to create the memory object.

Entry point is optional as it requires device support for
``mux_allocation_capabilities_cached_host`` and **must** return
``mux_error_feature_unsupported`` if this is not the case.

.. code:: c

   mux_result_t muxCreateMemoryFromHost(
       mux_device_t device,
       size_t size,
       void* host_pointer,
       mux_allocator_info_t allocator_info,
       mux_memory_t* out_memory);

-  ``device`` - the ``mux_device_t`` to create this memory for.
-  ``size`` - the size in bytes of allocated memory.
-  ``host_pointer`` - pointer to pre-allocated host addressable memory,
   **must not** be NULL.
-  ``allocator_info`` - the user provided allocator **should** be used
   for host memory allocations as described in the
   `Allocators <#allocators>`__ section.
-  ``out_memory`` - the created memory, or uninitialized if an error
   occurred.

..

   Note that ``allocator_info`` **must** be used for any allocations
   required for the host-side implementation of this API entry point.
   There is no requirement for it to be used for the allocation of
   physical device memory.

.. rubric:: Return Codes

-  If ``device`` does not report
   ``mux_allocation_capabilities_cached_host`` in
   ``mux_device_info_s::allocation_capabilities``,
   ``mux_error_feature_unsupported`` must be returned.
-  If ``size`` is 0, ``mux_error_invalid_value`` **must** be
   returned.
-  If ``memory_properties`` is 0, ``mux_error_invalid_value``
   **must** be returned.

   **must** be returned.
-  If ``allocator_info`` function pointer fields are ``NULL``,
   ``mux_error_null_allocator_callback`` **must** be returned.
-  If ``out_memory`` is NULL, ``mux_error_null_out_parameter`` **must**
   be returned.
-  Otherwise ``mux_success`` **should** be returned.

If an error code other than ``mux_success`` is returned,
``out_memory`` **must not** be used.

.. rubric:: Valid Usage

-  Calls to ``muxCreateMemoryFromHost()`` **shall** be considered
   thread-safe.
-  The value of ``size`` **must not** exceed the ``allocation_size``
   member of ``device``.

deallocated. Otherwise, if ``memory`` was created by a call to
``muxCreateMemoryFromHost()`` then the underlying host memory **must
not** be deallocated.

.. code:: c

Images are represented by the ``mux_image_t`` handle which contains
metadata about images. ``mux_image_t`` objects do not hold ownership of
physical device memory, this delegated to ``mux_memory_t`` objects.
Images are acted upon by a number of entry points as defined below.

A Mux implementation **must** populate the following attributes of the
``mux_image_s`` structure so that the application can use this
information to correctly use ``mux_image_t`` objects.

.. code:: c

   struct mux_image_s {

muxCreateImage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``muxCreateImage()`` function is used to create a ``mux_image_t``
object, it describes the images type and dimensions. This does not
allocate physical device memory to store the image data, to do this
``muxAllocateMemory()`` must be used, the ``mux_memory_t`` can then be
bound to the ``mux_image_t`` using ``muxBindImageMemory()``.

.. code:: c

   mux_result_t muxCreateImage(
       mux_device_t device,
       mux_image_type_e type,

       uint64_t slice_size,
       mux_allocator_info_t allocator_info,
       mux_image_t* out_image);

   images, must be greater than one and less than max height for 2d and
   3d images.

   ``0`` for non image arrays, must be less than max array layers for
   image arrays.

-  ``allocator_info`` - the user provided allocator **should** be used
   for host memory allocations as described in the
   `Allocators <#allocators>`__ section.
-  ``out_image`` - The created image, or uninitialized if an error
   occurred.

..

   Note that ``allocator_info`` **must** be used for any allocations
   required for the host-side implementation of this API entry point.
   There is no requirement for it to be used for the allocation of
   physical device memory.

Queries
-------

Queries allow the application to query the implementation about runtime
behavior by providing a mechanism to report performance data. Multiple
queries **may** be active at one time, a query is considered to be
active as long as there is an existing query pool to which its
corresponding ``mux_query_type_e`` (and its specific ``uuid`` in the
case of ``mux_query_type_counter``) was passed during creation. Note
that in the case of counter queries, each active query takes a number
of hardware counters to support, as denoted by
``mux_query_counter_s::hardware_counters``. The number of hardware
counters needed to support all active counter queries **must** not
exceed the device's limit, as defined by
``mux_device_info_s::max_active_hardware_counters``. The storage for
the query data resides in a ``mux_query_pool_t`` object.

.. code:: c

   struct mux_query_pool_s {
     mux_id_t id;
     mux_query_type_e type;
     uint32_t count;
   };

-  ``id`` - the ID of this query pool object.
-  ``type`` - the type of the query pool (one of the values in the enum

Command Buffers
---------------

Command buffers in Mux are a collection of commands that will be
dispatched and executed on a device. Commands within a command buffer
**must** be executed *as if* in the order they are pushed onto the
command buffer.

   Command buffer implementations **must not** access Mux semaphores of
   completed command buffers they wait on, otherwise code using Mux
   **may** deadlock due to resetting semaphores. One approach to
   implement command buffers is for command buffers to track which other
   command buffers wait on them while adding a counter to represent the
   number of command buffers they are waiting on. When a command buffer
   completes then decrease the counters of all command buffers waiting on
   it. Command buffers are only ready to run when their waiting counter
   is zero.

Synchronization of commands within the same command-buffer is done by
``mux_sync_point_s`` synchronization points (sync-point). Each command recording
entry-point can return a sync-point for other commands to wait on, and in turn
take a list of sync-points to wait on itself. There are no create or destroy
entry-points for user control of the sync-point lifetimes. Instead
``mux_sync_point_s`` objects are valid for the lifetime of the command-buffer
they were created from.

.. warning::

  The restriction that commands in a command-buffer must be executed as if
  in-order will be relaxed once sync-points are fully implemented for all
  targets.

muxCreateCommandBuffer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``muxCreateCommandBuffer()`` creates a command_buffer from a given Mux
device.

.. code:: c

   mux_result_t muxCreateCommandBuffer(
       mux_device_t device,
       mux_callback_info_t callback_info,
       mux_allocator_info_t allocator_info,
       mux_command_buffer_t* out_command_buffer);

-  ``device`` - the ``mux_device_t`` to create this command buffer with.
-  ``callback_info`` - the user provided callback, which **may** be
   null, can be used by the implementation to provide detailed messages
   about command buffer execution to the user.
-  ``allocator_info`` - the user provided allocator **should** be used
   for host memory allocations as described in the
   `Allocators <#allocators>`__ section.
-  ``out_command_buffer`` - the newly created command buffer.

.. rubric:: Return Codes

-  If ``allocator_info`` function pointer fields are ``NULL``,
   ``mux_error_null_allocator_callback`` **must** be returned.
-  If ``out_command_buffer`` is NULL, ``mux_error_null_out_parameter``
   **must** be returned.
-  Otherwise ``mux_success`` **should** be returned.

If an error code other than ``mux_success`` is returned,
``out_command_buffer`` **must not** be used.

.. rubric:: Valid Usage

-  Calls to ``muxCreateCommandBuffer()`` **shall** be considered
   thread-safe.

.. rubric:: Validation Rules

-  The ``mux_device_t`` that was used in the creation of the
   ``mux_command_buffer_t`` **must not** be destroyed before the command
   group has been destroyed.

muxFinalizeCommandBuffer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``muxFinalizeCommandBuffer()`` finalizes a ``mux_command_buffer_t``.

.. code:: c

   mux_result_t muxFinalizeCommandBuffer(
       mux_command_buffer_t command_buffer);

-  ``command_buffer`` - the ``mux_command_buffer_t`` to be finalized.

.. rubric:: Return Codes

-  If ``command_buffer`` is ``NULL``, ``mux_error_null_out_parameter`` **must**
   be returned.

-  Otherwise ``mux_success`` **should** be returned.

If an error code other than ``mux_success`` is returned,
``command_buffer`` **may** not be in a valid state.

.. rubric:: Valid Usage:

- Calls to ``muxFinalizeCommandBuffer()`` operating on distinct
  ``command_buffer``\ ’s **shall** be considered thread-safe.
- Subsequent calls to ``muxFinalizeCommandBuffer()`` with the same ``command_buffer``
  will have no effect on ``command_buffer``.

.. rubric::  Validation Rules:

- ``command_buffer`` **must** not have further commands pushed to it after
  ``muxFinalizeCommandBuffer()`` is called unless ``muxResetCommandBuffer()``
  is called first.
- All ``mux_command_buffer_t`` s must be finalized before being passed to a
  ``muxDispatch()`` call.

muxCloneCommandBuffer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``muxCloneCommandBuffer()`` clones a ``mux_command_buffer_t``.

Entry point is optional and **must** return ``mux_error_feature_unsupported`` if
it is not supported.

.. code:: c

   mux_result_t muxCloneCommandBuffer(
       mux_device_t device,
       mux_allocator_info_t allocator_info,
       mux_command_buffer_t command_buffer,
       mux_command_buffer_t* out_command_buffer);

- ``device`` - the ``mux_device_t`` to create the new command buffer with.
- ``allocator_info`` - the user provided allocator **should** be used for host
  memory allocations as described in the `Allocators <#allocators>`__ section.
- ``command_buffer`` - the ``mux_command_buffer_t`` to be cloned.
- ``out_command_buffer`` - the newly created command buffer.

.. note::
  Currently the caller expectations of this entry-point are that the clone
  needs to deep copy the ndrange kernel commands only, and other
  commands and resources may be shallow copied.

.. rubric:: Return Codes:

- If ``device`` does not support cloning command buffers
  i.e. ``mux_device_info_s::can_clone_command_buffers == false``
  ``mux_error_feature_unsupported`` must be returned.
- If ``allocator_info`` function pointer fields are ``NULL``,
  ``mux_error_null_allocator_callback`` **must** be returned.
- If ``command_buffer`` is ``NULL``, ``mux_error_invalid_value`` **must** be
  returned.
- If ``out_command_buffer`` is ``NULL``, ``mux_error_null_out_parameter`` **must** be
  returned.
- Otherwise ``mux_success`` **should** be returned.

If an error code other than ``mux_success`` or ``mux_error_feature_unsupported``
is returned, ``out_command_buffer`` **may** not be in a valid state.

.. rubric:: Valid Usage:

- Calls to ``muxCloneCommandBuffer()`` operating on distinct ``command_buffers``'s
  **shall** be considered thread-safe.
- ``mux_command_buffer_t``s passed as the ``mux_command_buffer`` parameter **must** be
  in the *finalized* state.
- A ``mux_device_t`` passed as the ``device`` parameter **must** be the same
  ``device`` that was passed to the ``muxCreateCommandBuffer`` call used create the
  ``command_buffer`` parameter.

.. rubric:: Validation Rules:

- ``out_command_buffer`` **must** not have further commands pushed to it after
  ``muxCloneCommandBuffer()`` is called unless ``muxResetCommandBuffer()``
  is called first.
- The ``mux_device_t`` that was used in the creation of the
  ``mux_command_buffer_t`` that is returned via the ``out_command_buffer`` parameter
  **must not** be destroyed before the command buffer has been destroyed.

muxUpdateDescriptors
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``muxUpdateDescriptors`` updates the ``mux_descriptor_info_t`` descriptors
associated with an ND range command enqueued via ``muxCommandNDRange()``. This
entry point updates arguments to an ND range in a command buffer.

Entry point is optional as it requires device support for updating descriptors and
**must** return ``mux_error_feature_unsupported`` if this is not the case.

.. code:: c

   mux_result_t muxUpdateDescriptors(mux_command_buffer_t command_buffer,
                                    mux_command_id_t command_id,

                                    mux_descriptor_info_t *descriptors);

- ``command_buffer`` - the command buffer containing the NDRange command.
- ``command_id`` - the ID that uniquely identifies the NDRange command within
                 ``command_buffer`` by the index of command within the command
                 buffer.
- ``num_args`` - the number of arguments to be updated.
- ``arg_indices`` - the indices of the arguments to be updated.
- ``descriptors`` - the descriptors for the new arguments.

.. rubric:: Return Codes

- If the device associated with ``command_buffer`` does not support updating
  descriptors i.e. ``mux_device_info_s::descriptors_updatable == false``
  ``mux_error_feature_unsupported`` must be returned.
- Otherwise ``mux_success`` **should** be returned.

If an error code other than ``mux_success`` is returned, ``command_buffer``
**should** be considered unchanged and the arguments to the ND Range command
identified by ``command_id`` **should** be considered unchanged.

.. rubric:: Valid Usage

- Calls to ``muxUpdateDescriptors()`` operating on distinct ``command_buffer``'s
  **shall** be considered thread-safe.
- The ``command_buffer`` **shall** be in the *finalized* state when it
  passed to ``muxUpdateDescriptors()``.
- The type of a descriptor **should not** be changed unless it is between:
  ``mux_descriptor_info_type_buffer`` and
  ``mux_descriptor_info_type_null_buffer``.
- If any descriptors of type ``mux_descriptor_info_type_plain_old_data``
  change their size, the behaviour is undefined.

.. rubric:: Validation Rules

-  A ``mux_command_buffer_t`` that has been dispatched to a queue via

   executing.

muxTryWait
~~~~~~~~~~

``muxTryWait()`` attempts to wait on a ``mux_fence_t`` to be signaled on
completion of a ``mux_command_buffer_t`` that is executing on a given queue
dispatched via ``muxDispatch()``.

.. code:: c

   mux_result_t muxTryWait(

       mux_fence_t fence);

-  ``queue`` - a queue previously created by a call to
   ``muxGetQueue()``.
-  ``timeout`` - a timeout period in units of nanoseconds. The value of
   ``timeout`` is adjusted to the closest value supported by the target's
   timeout accuracy, this **may** be longer than one nanosecond and hence
   ``muxTryWait`` may wait longer than the period defined by ``timeout``.
-  ``fence`` - a fence previously used in a call to
   ``muxDispatch()`` on the given ``queue``.

.. rubric:: Return Codes

-  If the ``fence`` has not yet been signaled,
   ``mux_fence_not_ready`` **must** be returned.
-  If the ``fence`` has been signaled,
   ``mux_error_fence_failure`` **may** be returned.
-  Otherwise ``mux_success`` **should** be returned.

.. rubric:: Valid Usage

   dispatched with a command buffer on the given ``queue`` via a call to
   ``muxDispatch()``.
-  ``muxTryWaitTest()`` **may** wait for the suggested ``timeout`` period.
   Passing ``0`` for the ``timeout`` parameter indicates there is no timeout
   period.

Execution Model
---------------

This section briefly details Mux's execution model: how work is defined for a
Mux device, and how the execution of work on that device can be controlled with
the API.

The smallest unit of work that can be created for a device at the Mux API level
is the command. These are the operations defined with the ``muxCommand`` entry
points, they include commands such as :ref:`Buffer
<specifications/mux-runtime-spec:buffers>` operations
(reading/writing/copying), and :ref:`Kernel
<specifications/mux-runtime-spec:kernels>` executions.

Commands are not directly executed, instead they are first added to
:ref:`Command Buffers <specifications/mux-runtime-spec:Command Buffers>`. A
Command Buffer can be thought of as a list of N commands that must be executed
*as if* in the order they were added to the Command Buffer. The *as if* wording
is important: by defining this in-order execution requirement in terms of side
effects rather than absolute execution order, we allow Mux implementations to
execute commands within Command Buffers concurrently as long as there are no
dependencies between them.  Command Buffers are the *executable* unit of work
in the Mux API. Once finalized with a call to ``muxFinalizeCommandBuffer`` a
Command Buffer can be submitted to a :ref:`Queue
<specifications/mux-runtime-spec:queues>` for immediate execution on the
associated Mux device with a ``muxDispatch`` call.

.. .. todo:: Mux Command Buffer lifecycle diagram illustrating the possible
   command buffer states and the ways to transition between them. See CA-3697

Command Buffers executing in a Queue do not have any implicit ordering
guarantees relative to any other executing Command Buffers. Any execution
dependencies between Command Buffers must be manually enforced with the
:ref:`Semaphore <specifications/mux-runtime-spec:semaphores>` primitive. When a
Mux Command Buffer is dispatched, a list of wait Semaphores and a list of
signal Semaphores can optionally also be provided. A Command Buffer will wait
until all of its wait Semaphores are in the signalled state before commencing
execution on the device, and when finished it will put each of its signal
Semaphores into the signalled state. A common use of this mechanism is to
dispatch every Command Buffer with one signal Semaphore, and have it wait on
the signal Semaphores of all currently executing Command Buffers, thus creating
a queue that is guaranteed to execute each of its Command Buffers in the order
they were dispatched.
