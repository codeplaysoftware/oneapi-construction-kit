ComputeMux Change Log
=====================

The change log contains, **with most recent items at the beginning**,
changes made to the ComputeMux API. Versioning follows the `semantic
versioning <http://semver.org/>`__ scheme; major version increments
signify incompatible API changes, minor version bumps denote the
addition of new functionality which is backward compatible, and patch
version increases mean backward compatible bug fixes have been applied.

   Versions prior to 1.0.0 may contain breaking changes in minor
   versions as the API is still under development.

  ``compiler::Kernel::createSpecializedKernel``.
  ``compiler::Kernel::createMuxSpecializedKernel`` was an implementation detail
  of ``compiler::BaseKernel`` which has now been removed.
* ``compiler::SpecializedKernel`` has been removed.
* ``compiler::BaseTarget`` now loads the builtins module for the given builtin
  capabilities as part of ``compiler::BaseTarget::init``. Compiler targets
  should implement ``compiler::BaseTarget::initWithBuiltins`` instead. Unlike
  ``init``, ``initWithBuiltins`` does not need to delegate to
  ``compiler::BaseTarget`` first, as it's a pure virtual function.
* The notification callback passed to ``compiler::Target::init`` is now passed
  to ``compiler::Info::createTarget`` and is now of type
  ``compiler::NotifyCallbackFn``. This should be passed along to
  ``compiler::BaseTarget``'s constructor.

0.53.2
------

* Change the ``user_function`` argument of ``muxCommandUserCallback`` to use the
  ``mux_command_user_callback_t`` type, rather than the function pointer type

  ``core_executable_flags_e`` bitfield and a C string for the name and value of
  any device specific build options passed by the user.
* Redefine ``core_executable_s`` struct to have a ``core_executable_options_t``
  member rather than the ``core_executable_flags_e`` bitfield.

    lifecycle, ``coreGetQueryPoolResults()`` is used to provide the results to the
    application.
  * The ``core_query_type_e`` enumeration defines a set of possible queries,
    currently only ``core_query_type_duration`` is supported and is intended to
    report the start and end timestamps of a command, results are reported using
    the ``core_query_duration_result_t`` object.
  * The ``corePushBeginQuery()`` and ``corePushEndQuery()`` entry points define the
    range of commands for which a ``core_query_pool_t`` is to be used in a
    ``core_command_group_t``\ , ``corePushResetQueryPool()`` is used to zero all query
    results in the spcified range within the ``core_query_pool_t``.

  mask to match any of the LLVM source capability bits.

0.34.0
------

* Add support for custom buffer descriptors, this allows passing through
  arbitrary data from the user to the Core target in addition to the address
  space provided by the compiler frontend. This includes:

  * The ``custom_buffer_capabilities`` data member of ``core_device_info_s``
    describing which custom buffer capabilities the Core target supports.
  * The ``core_custom_capabilities_e`` enumeration of custom buffer capabilities.
  * The ``core_descriptor_info_custom_buffer_s`` structure to describe the custom
    buffer to the Core target.
  * The ``core_descriptor_info_type_custom_buffer`` enumeration value to specify
    that a descriptor is a custom buffer.

0.33.1
------

* Clarify that whitespace characters other than `` `` are not supported in
  built-in kernel declarations.

0.33.0
------

* Add allocator validity check to ``id.h`` and rename it to ``utils.h``.

0.31.1
------

* Weaken requirement that host-side allocations **must** use the user
  provided allocator to that they **should** use it. This enables use of
  third-party libraries, like LLVM or the C standard library, which do not
  support user provided allocators and should not affect existing target
  implementations.

0.31.0
------

* Supersede ``generate_core_header`` with ``add_core_target``\ , this also simplifies
  the mechanism by which targets register themselves and how they specify their
  capabilities in addition to creating a CMake target to generate the core
  target header.
* Add ``add_core_cross_compilers`` which simplifies the mechanism for registering
  a targets cross-compilers with the ``cross`` target.

0.30.0
------

* Add requirement that commands in a command group must be executed in the order
  they were pushed onto the command group, making command groups in-order.

  support.
* Added a matching ``coreDestroyBinary`` to destroy binaries created by the above
  two functions.

0.27.0
------

* Separate device enumeration from initialization by adding a new structure:
  ``core_device_info_t``\ , and a new function: ``coreGetDeviceInfos``.
* ``coreCreateDevices`` hook API has changed - a new hook for ``coreGetDeviceInfos``
  was added, which has an almost identical interface to the existing
  ``coreCreateDevices`` hook.

0.26.1
------

* Add ``core_executable_flags_dma_never`` and
  ``core_executable_flags_vectorize_never`` enum values to
  ``core_executable_flags_e``\ , so that the core implementations are informed of
  whether the user chose explicitly to enable/disable these optimizations, or
  if the default behavior is to be used when neither the ``never`` nor ``always``

  binaries to be from LLVM 5.0.
* Add ``core_source_capabilities_llvm_50`` to ``core_source_capabilities_e`` to
  allow input binaries to be from LLVM 5.0.

0.19.0

  passed a device making the API consistent across all create and destroy
  functions.

0.18.1
------

  functions as builtins that core targets must replace if they use the automatic
  DMA.

0.18.0
------

* Add ``core_allocator_info`` argument to all entry points which perform host
  allocations to support Vulkan style user allocator override.

0.17.3
------

* Add ``compute_units`` to ``core_device_s`` to let implementations pass information
  on how many compute units their device has.

0.17.2
------

  given kernel.

0.14.0
------

* Removed ``<client>PushTerminate()`` as it put a higher burden on client targets
  than was necessary.

0.13.0
------

* Add ``<client>GetBinary()`` to retrieve the binary representation of a
  ``core_executable_t``.
* Add ``core_source_type_binary`` to ``core_source_flags_e`` to allow the input to
  be a binary for the given core target.
* Add ``core_source_capabilities_binary`` to ``core_source_capabilities_e`` to allow
  a core target to advertise it can support creating executables from binaries.
* Rename ``<client>CreateQueue()`` to ``<client>GetQueue()`` and change the function
  signature to take two extra parameters for the queue type and index.
  ``core_queue_t``\ 's now belong to the device, and are queried from the device,
  rather than an arbitrary number of them being created (which simplifies the
  engineering effort required by our customers).
* Add new enum ``core_queue_type_e`` to denote all possible types of queue we can
  support - at present this only contains ``core_queue_type_compute``\ , but is
  available for extension later.
* Add new field to ``core_device_t`` to query the number of queues of each
  ``core_queue_type_e`` a device supports.

0.10.0
------

* Added ``builtins_type``\ , ``builtins``\ , and ``builtins_length`` parameters to
  ``<client>CreateFinalizer()`` to pass the compute APIs standard library to the
  core client target for linking. Client targets must now link in the builtin
  function definitions themselves to use our provided implementations. By moving
  the responsibility for linking to the client target, clients now have a
  mechanism to intercept any of the builtin functions with target specific
  optimizations, before linking in any remaining builtins that the client does
  not have optimized support for.

0.9.0
-----

  data currently residing in host memory.
* Add ``<client>FlushMappedMemoryFromDevice()`` to synchronize host memory with
  data currently residing in device memory.

  ``<client>FlushMappedMemoryToDevice()`` and
  ``<client>FlushMappedMemoryFromDevice()`` to perform flushing instead.
* Remove ``core_mapping_type_e``\ , ``coreMapMemory()`` and ``coreUnmapMemory()`` are no
  longer required to synchronize memory.

0.6.2
-----

* Remove ``max_instructions_issued_per_cycle`` from ``core_device_s`` as it is no

  to guestimate.

0.6.1
-----

* Change ``core_source_type_e`` and ``core_source_capabilities_e`` to be the LLVM
  version of the bitcode module being passed in (which more correctly fits our
  usage).
* LLVM bitcode modules being passed in with ``core_source_type_llvm_38`` and
  ``core_source_type_llvm_39`` must have the "unknown-unknown-unknown" target
  triple now.

  command group has completed executing.
* Change ``<client>Dispatch`` to include a command group complete callback and
  user data.
* Add ``core_error_command_group_failure`` to ``core_error_e`` enum to signal that a
  command group that was waited on failed.
* Add ``core_error_command_group_wait_semaphore_failure`` to ``core_error_e`` enum
  to signal that a command group that was waiting on another command group via a
  semaphore failed because the other command group failed.
* Add ``core_error_command_group_not_ready`` to ``core_error_e`` enum to signal that
  a command group that was waited on was not yet complete.
* Add extra parameter to ``<client>PushFillImage`` to specify the size of the user
  memory being passed in as the color parameter.
* Add function ``<client>PushTerminate`` to signal that a command group should
  terminate, and any semaphore in the chain of waits on it, should not execute.

  allocation with a buffer object. This also adds first class support to the API
  for ``clCreateSubBuffer``.

  buffers, images, or both buffers and images. Add typedef to the definition to
  allow passing as a function parameter.
